# ClimaApp
- Build an iOS weather app, fetch weather data from API and display it dynamically
- Load weather API data from the website https://api.openweathermap.org
- Using CoreLocation to get access to user's location
- When we run the app, it will load the weather of the user's current location. User could type any other cities on the textField to get the weather data of those cities. And when user tap on the location button on the top left of the screen, it will switch back to the weather data of user's current location.

Here is the video demo:
